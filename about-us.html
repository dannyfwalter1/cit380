      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p id="about-us-intro">We are a non-profit organization dedicated to improving individuals' quality of life through healthy habits. <br><br>
          We live in a world where people are constantly cycling through pointless workout plans and fad diets that often do more harm than good.
          Here at Sanuvi fitness we pride ourselves on transparency about fitness and eating habits. <br><br>
          We'll offer you a variety of options when it comes to fitness because everyone has different goals and often times exercises aren't one-size-fits-all. <br><br>
          We'll also help you understand the importance of eating to live and living to eat. <br><br>
          Everyone is different and is in a different situation. Our goal is to help you make the right options when it comes to moving your body and fueling it.</p>
