    <h2>Fitness</h2>

    <p>Too many people suffer from weak backs, shortness of breath after climbing a flight of stairs, the inability to tie their shoes without straining themselves, and difficulty playing sports we used to play in highschool. <br> Below are listed four of the main categories that are essential to each person's life. We're not saying you have to do all of them everyday or be masters of them. Rather, we encourage everyone to have some sort of capability to do all of these. Its important to start easy to avoid injury and to make it easier to stay consistent and build the habit. <br> According to the Mayo Clinic, everyone should be getting atleast 150 minutes of exercise a week. Its a lot less intimidating if you break that up into 30 minutes over 5 days or even 50 minutes over 3 days. Overall fitness improves your current and future quality of life.</p>

      <h3>Strength</h3>
      <p>It's the ability to carry out work against a resistance. Apart from maintaining and developing muscle, strength also helps develop strong bones, manage weight, and enhance your overall quality of life.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Aerobics</h3>
      <p>It's the same thing as cardiovascular conditioning or "cardio". Aerobics helps your overall cardiovascular system including lowering your risk for heart disease (the number one cause of death in the US), control blood sugar, improves lung function (endurance), and decreases heart rate.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>The ability of a joint or joints to move through an unrestricted, pain-free range of motion. This helps you stay loose, increases muscle blood flow, and reduces the risk of injuries.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Athleticism</h3>
      <p>The ability to perform a range of movements with precision and confidence in a variety of environments. Athleticism requires the skills listed above as well as motor skills, agility, balance, and coordination.</p>
