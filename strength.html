    <h2>Strength</h2>
    <p>Strength is the ability to exert enough force to overcome resistance. It can be moving one's body or weight from point A to point B and back. </p>  
    
    <p>Moving one's body for exercise is a form of exercise called calisthenics. Calisthenic exercises are a great option for exercise because they often require little to no equipment, and if they do they can be easily modified to things found around your house or neighborhood. Since your body is really the only "weight" needed, it's easier on your joints for those that suffer from joint pain. Calisthenic exercises include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Pull ups (back and biceps)</li>
      <li>Crunches (core)</li>
      <li>Push ups (chest, shoulders, and triceps)</li>
      <li>Body weight squats (legs and core)</li>
      <li>Dips (chest and triceps)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Using weights like dumbells, barbells, and kettlebells are also a great option for building strength. With proper technique, using weights allow you to put an increased strain on your muscles and bones which in turn strengthens them. Going to a gym is a great option for using weights, but a pair of dumbells, barbell and a pair of plates, or kettle bell at home work just as great. Some of the following exercises can be done with whichever "-bell" you decide to use:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Squats (legs and core)</li>
      <li>Bench Press (chest, shoulders, and triceps)</li>
      <li>Shoulder Press (shoulders and triceps)</li>
      <li>Rows (back and biceps)</li>
      <li>Lunges (legs and core)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's incredibly important that whichever route you can choose that you use proper technique. Proper technique allows you to exercise safe and longer and helps you build muscle.</p>
