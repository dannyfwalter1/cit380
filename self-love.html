    <h2>Self Love</h2>
    <p>Self love is an important philosophy that allows us to make changes that last. Too often, people begin making changes out of self loathing, and often don't progress or once they progress, they fall back into old habits. The reasoning behind self love is that for someone you care dearly for, you'll go above an beyond. If we love ourselves, we'll go above and beyond for ourselves as well.</p>

    <p>If this is something that you struggle with, just know you are an amazing person and you can achieve great things. You also don't need to love yourself entirely to start your wellness and fitness journey. Its a trade-off. As you practice self love, you will do things to improve your life. As you improve your life, you will discover things about yourself and be able to practice self love. The following are things you can do to increase self love. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Journaling</li>
      <li>Surrounding yourself with positive people</li>
      <li>Reciting affirmations</li>
      <li>Accept compliments</li>
      <li>Take care of your body</li>
    </ul>
