      <h2>Self Love</h2>
      <p>The ability to love yourself is correlated with better physical and of course mental health. It isn't a cure-all but it is an important step in improving your life. If you love yourself you'll eventually do the things you need to do to take care of your mind and body.</p>

      <h2>Rest</h2>
      <p>We need about seven to nine hours of sleep a night. About 30% of people in the US aren't getting less than the recommended hours of sleep. Sleeping improves our immune system, combat weight gain, think clearly, and reduce the risk of health issues like diabetes and heart disease.</p>
