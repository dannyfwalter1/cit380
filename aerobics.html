    <h2>Aerobics</h2>
    <p>Walking, Biking, Running...Anything that keeps your heart rate up and heavy breathing is a form of cardio. Other forms of aerobics include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rowing</li>
      <li>Jump rope</li>
      <li>Swimming</li>
      <li>Dancing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When starting out, we recommend you start small. Walking (treadmill or outside), Swimming, and biking around the neighborhood are a few examples of good starts. Starting small helps you make the habit and keeps you from injuring yourself. The absolute minimum everyone should be doing is 30 minutes apart from your normal routine over five days. This helps you reduce the risk of heart disease and hypertension</p>

    <p>You won't become an elite athlete overnight, but you can make small changes to increase the intensity. Increasing intensity helps you improve cario-respiratory fitness and helps you manage weight. Increasing speed, resistance, and duration all help in increasing intensity. Some of the best things you can have with you during these is a smart watch, stop watch, or heart rate monitor.</p>
