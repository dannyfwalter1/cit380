    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>We can't repeat this enough: eat to live and live to eat. Food is incredibly important to us as humans. It has always been our source of energy. It has also become a form of comfort and unity among communities and cultures. Our goal here at Sunavi is to develop and maintain positive attitudes about food.</p>

    <p>Toxic dieting culture is restrictive and unsustainable. This includes harsh calorie restrictions and avoiding food groups to promote fast results in your physical appearance. However, it does more harm than good to our bodies and also our minds. Losing weight is hard. Developing and maintaining healthy eating habits is hard "Dieting" is even harder and just unnecessary. According to the Cleveland Clinic, approximately 80 to 95% of people who participate in toxic dieting culture end up gaining the weight back.</p>

    <p>A well balanced diet, contrary to popular belief will consist of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Proteins are the building blocks of life. You need protein to repair body cells and make new ones. Fats give your body energy and support cell function. Some important roles of fat is the absorption of vitamins A, D, and E, protect your organs, and regulating hormones. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose for your brain. Fiber falls under the category for carbohydrates which is needed for healthy bowel movements. The following are examples of the three macronutrients that your body needs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Protein
        <ul>
          <li>Meat</li>
          <li>Fish</li>
          <li>Soy</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Fat
        <ul>
          <li>Nut Butters</li>
          <li>Seeds</li>
          <li>Fish</li>
          <li>Avocados</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Carbohydrate
        <ul> 
          <li>Vegetables</li>
          <li>Fruits</li>
          <li>Beans</li>
          <li>Grains</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We're here to introduce positive eating habits. What if we told you you can eat anything you want and still lose weight?Our approach is called addition and substitution. <br> Imagine this: You start your day with two bowls of cereal and milk and some orange juice. What can you add? What can you substitute? Perhaps you might swap out one bowl of cereal for a bowl of oats or whole wheat toast to reduce added sugar intake. Perhaps you might add an egg or two to increase your protein intake. <br> Consider another scenario, the usual Friday night consists of you ordering pizza delivery, a large pepperoni with a Coke. Perhaps you might order a medium or a small to control your portion size easier. Perhaps you might add vegetables to the pizza or have some carrots on the side to increase your vegetable intake. Perhaps you might swap out the Coca-cola for a nice cold Diet Coke.</p>

    <p>Now weight only comes off as you're in whats called a calorie deficit. You burn more calories than you take in. The goal of addition and substitution is for you to make better food choices so that getting into a calorie deficit will be easy. Below is a calculator that will determine your daily caloric intake to lose, maintain, and gain weight based on a few given parameters. Our recommendation is that you get comfortable with additiona and substitution before you start keeping track of your calories.</p>

    <p>The idea is for you to make gradual changes that will lead to strong habits. You don't have to give up entire food groups or have a harsh restriction on calories either.</p>
